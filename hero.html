                <h3>Iron Man ü§ñ</h3>
                <p>Iron Man will always be my favorite‚Äînot because he‚Äôs rich or flashy, but because he‚Äôs just a guy with
                    a brilliant mind and a huge heart. He doesn‚Äôt have any powers, yet he builds his own legacy with
                    nothing but raw intelligence and unstoppable will. His growth hit me hard‚Äîfrom a careless
                    billionaire to someone who gave everything to save everyone. Every joke, every upgrade to his suit,
                    every moment he stood tall? It made him feel so real. Honestly, I‚Äôll never stop admiring him. Tony
                    Stark isn‚Äôt just cool‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs everything.</p>

                <h3>Thor (God of Thunder) ‚ö°üî®</h3>
                <p>Thor might be a literal god, but he‚Äôs so much more than his strength. He‚Äôs faced loss after loss‚Äîhis
                    home, his brother, his confidence‚Äîand still finds a way to fight for others. He‚Äôs powerful, yeah,
                    but he‚Äôs also kind, loyal, and full of heart. His journey from an arrogant warrior to a humble
                    protector is honestly beautiful. And when he smiles or cracks a joke, it‚Äôs impossible not to smile
                    too. I don‚Äôt just admire him‚ÄîI feel proud of him.</p>

                <h3>Wanda Maximoff (Scarlet Witch) üîÆ‚ù§Ô∏è</h3>
                <p>Wanda‚Äôs story is pure emotion. She‚Äôs been through so much pain, so much loss, and yet her love never
                    fades. She‚Äôs powerful in ways that go beyond magic‚Äîher strength is emotional, raw, and real.
                    Watching her struggle, heal, and break again felt so personal. She‚Äôs not perfect, and that‚Äôs what
                    makes her unforgettable. Wanda is chaos and love, grief and hope. Every time she appears on screen,
                    it‚Äôs like the world holds its breath.</p>

                <h3>Loki (God of Mischief) üåÄüêç</h3>
                <p>Loki is one of the most fascinating characters ever. He‚Äôs not just a villain or a trickster‚Äîhe‚Äôs
                    someone constantly fighting for identity and love. He‚Äôs broken but brilliant, misunderstood but
                    unforgettable. Watching him grow, especially in the series, made me feel for him in ways I didn‚Äôt
                    expect. Beneath all the mischief is a heart that just wants to be seen. And honestly? His style, his
                    charm, that chaotic energy? I adore it all.</p>

                <h3>Spider-Man (Peter Parker) üï∑Ô∏èüì∏</h3>
                <p>Spider-Man is the most relatable hero ever. He‚Äôs young, awkward, broke half the time‚Äîbut still
                    chooses to do the right thing, even when it hurts. "With great power comes great responsibility"
                    isn‚Äôt just a quote, it‚Äôs how he lives. The way he balances being Peter and Spider-Man, losing so
                    much and still showing up... it honestly breaks my heart and inspires me every time. He‚Äôs proof that
                    being a hero isn‚Äôt about powers‚Äîit‚Äôs about the choices you make. I just love him so much for that.
